# Midas Assistant

Midas is a desktop assistant that you can access by clicking its icon on the bottom right of your screen. Once you click the icon you will be taken to a chat window (shown in the demo below). You can ask Midas simple questions, and it will retain a running memory of who you are and what you ask, along with a chat history! I plan to add MCP so that it can automate workflows, and I want to add nanobrowser to allow Midas to use the web.
